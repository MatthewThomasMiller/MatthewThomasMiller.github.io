Matthew Thomas Miller is Assistant Professor of Persian Literature and Digital Humanities at [Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park](http://sllc.umd.edu/persian) and affiliate faculty of the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](https://mith.umd.edu/people/) and the [Religious Studies](https://jewishstudies.umd.edu/research/religious-studies) and [Comparative Literature](https://english.umd.edu/academic-programs/graduate/phd-comparative-literature) programs. He also serves as the Director of the [Roshan Initiative in Persian Digital Humanities (PersDig@UMD)](http://persdig.umd.edu/) and as the co-PI for the multi-institutional [Open Islamicate Texts Initiative (OpenITI)](https://openiti.org/) and the [Persian Manuscript Initiative (PMI)](http://www.persianmanuscript.org/). He has received generous funding for these projects from [The Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), [The National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/), [The National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and [The Islamic Manuscript Association](https://www.islamicmanuscript.org/home.aspx). His research focuses on Sufism; the history of sexuality, the body, sense, and affect/emotion; digital humanities; literary cultures of Middle Eastern revolutionary movements; and Orientalism/Islamophobia. He currently is working on four projects: a monograph on the role of affect/emotion in premodern Sufi epistemology and subject formation, entitled *Feeling Like Lovers: Affect in Medieval Sufism* (University of California Press); an edited volume of studies of premodern Persian literature (with Domenico Ingenito), entitled *Medieval and Early Modern Persian Poetry: Welcoming New Directions and Forgotten Geographies* (Edinburgh University Press); co-editing (with Kristina Richardson) a special issue/thematic dossier, entitled "From the Margins, From Below: Theoretical and Analytical Interventions in Premodern Middle Eastern Studies" in *Al-ʿUṣūr al-Wusṭā: the Journal of Middle East Medievalists* (scheduled to be published 2026); and a book of translations of the (in)famous "rogue lyrics" (*qalandariyyāt*) of Sanāʾī, ʿAṭṭār, and ʿIrāqī, entitled *God's Wild Lovers: The Ecstatic Lyrics of Sufism's Rogue Poets* (University of California Press).
