He also serves as the Director of the [Roshan Initiative in Persian Digital Humanities (PersDig@UMD)](http://persdig.umd.edu/) and as the co-PI for the multi-institutional [Open Islamicate Texts Initiative (OpenITI)](https://openiti.org/) and the [Persian Manuscript Initiative (PMI)](http://www.persianmanuscript.org/).
