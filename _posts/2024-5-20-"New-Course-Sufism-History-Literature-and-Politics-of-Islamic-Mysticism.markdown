*Sufism: History, Literature, and Politics of Islamic Mysticism* is an advanced introduction to the study of the history, literature, and politics of Sufism, the Islamic “mystical” mode of piety, from its origins to the modern period. In this course we will consider Sufism as a diverse cultural formation through the lens of power, gender, sexuality, the body/embodiment, affect/emotion, orientalism, and the senses while also deeply engaging its history, literature, and philosophical dimensions. The course does not require  any prior knowledge of Islamicate cultures and languages.
